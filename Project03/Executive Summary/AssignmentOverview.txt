Assigment Overview

This project brought out Key-Value Store closer to an actual real world application. This project focused on replicating the server and maintaining consistency among them. This helps our application to be more reliable and increase the availability of the servers for multiple clients. This was accomplished using JAVA RMI which again proved to be much efficient in accomplishing the task of replication of data replication. I created a coordinator server that keeps track of all the running servers and any server can call the coordinator’s server list directly using java RMI. This helped me to dynamically add new servers when the application is running, which is added to the running server list and a crash or close of a server will then be removed from that list. Data is also replicated from a running server. The most important scope of this project was to perform a hands-on implementation of a distributed algorithm, the Two-Phase Commit Protocol in this case. This made me understand some of the challenges and difficulties that can occur while implementing such distributed algorithms. Overall, the general project’s aim is to keep on growing on the previous project and to build a complex and scalable distributed systems which gets closer and closer to real world applications.
