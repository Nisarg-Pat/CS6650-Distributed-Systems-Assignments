Technical Impression:

This project required to implement Paxos algorithm. I found the algorithm quite difficult to understand in the first place but after iteratively understanding the algorithm and looking back to the lectures, I had an idea to proceed with the implementation. After getting a clear understanding of the algorithm, it was not much difficult of an algorithm to implement a basic version, even different sources for the algorithm contain a little tweaks about the working of the algorithm like the return values of the accept and propose methods.  The difficult part I faced was to create separate threads for Proposer, Acceptor and Listener. Since the original implementation included RMI, I can directly call the procedures without putting separate threads for the operations. I had to attend office hours to clarify the exact requirements for the same. In the end I was able to implement a solution that would make random failures for the server. Lastly since, the project followed the model for Project 3, no changes were required for client application as well as the docker files.
Overall, I found the project first as difficult, but as I got familiar with the way Paxos works and how to simply simulate the server crashes, it was an easier implementation afterwards that any of the previous projects.
