Assigment Overview

This project required a basic implementation of a widely used distributed algorithm: Paxos. Using the system model implemented for Project 3, it involved making the system to reach a consensus even during a small portion of server failures. The actual multi Paxos algorithm would also include a leader election that would act as the distinguished proposer. For this project, I made coordinator as the distinguished proposer. This project also asked to simulate server crashes. This was required to make the system more closer to a real life distributed system where server failures are likely to happen. The system is tested with failing servers running Paxos algorithm to still reach consensus. The scope of the assignment was to get familiar with the seemingly complicated Paxos Algorithm by implementing and understanding actually how it works. Along with this, it also made me about the distinctions between the Two Phase Commit Protocol and Paxos. Overall, all the projects were meant to understand the different requirements for a system to function properly under any conditions, and to provide a general idea on how to make the distributed applications more scalable making them more and more closer to an actual distributed system.
