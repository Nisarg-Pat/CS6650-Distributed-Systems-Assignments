Assigment Overview

This assignment consisted of creating two sets of applications using two different L4 communication protocols namely TCP and UDP. The purpose of this assignment was to get the basic understanding of how complex Client and Server applications are implemented and hosted in real world applications along with how some of the issues that could occur during the connection are handled. Creating a simple single threaded server and looking at the problems occurring with it helps to realize the importance of concurrency in a complex server that would get hundreds and thousands of requests every second. Since this was just a basic representation, adding complex features would bring it closer and closer to how real-world applications work, improving the scope of this project. More importantly I think additional purpose of this assignment was the understanding of usage of docker images and containers since it was hard to understand but once understood, it is a very useful platform. Overall, the assignment was a great starting point on understanding on how to build large and complex distributed systems, from testing all the way till deployment.
