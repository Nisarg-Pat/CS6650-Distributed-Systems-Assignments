Technical Impression:

Even before starting the project, when I read the homework document, I had some questions like in the line: “You will have to design a simple protocol”. It was not clear if we must create the protocol using XML or some other protocols. Also, about the unrequested datagram packets. Since it is a simple interaction of client and server, I was not knowing how to test this kind of cases. So, help from TA was required to clarify some of the requirements.
After starting the assignment, I was unsure which of the Tanenbaum’s client-server organization should I follow. I first had checks on client input on client side, but the code was getting redundant as same check I was applying on server side as well. I eventually ended up using the 2st organization, only the user interface on client side and the processing (including all checks) and data layer on the server side. Since the clients and the servers have some methods in common, I decided to add AbstractClient and AbstractServer that each client and server can extend.

In the end, this project required to make design choices, and after the project was completed I was satisfied with the way the applications work.
